# Solar Power Plant Performance Dashboard (Excel)

## Overview
This project analyzes one month of solar power generation data to evaluate plant performance, understand weather impacts, and identify underperforming days. A management-style Excel dashboard was developed to support operational decision-making.

## Dataset
The dataset contains daily records of:
- Date
- Solar Radiation (W/m²)
- Ambient Temperature (°C)
- Relative Humidity (%)
- Wind Speed (m/s)
- Energy Generated (kWh)

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- Line and scatter charts
- KPI calculations
- Trendline and correlation analysis

## Analysis Performed
- Daily energy generation trend analysis
- Energy vs solar radiation correlation
- Performance variability assessment
- Identification of abnormal low-output days

## Key Insights
- Energy output shows strong positive correlation with solar radiation.
- Few low-output days observed despite adequate radiation, suggesting temporary operational losses.
- No continuous degradation trend detected during the month.
- Overall plant performance was stable.
